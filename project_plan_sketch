Split of the work:
We plan to work on all the tasks together, however
I have more Python experience -> I will have more influence here
Gena has more networking experience -> he will rule here

How much time -> as much as it needs. However, we plan to have about 8 hours per week to sure that we will succeed. If we finish eariler - than good for us

Difficulties:
1. very biased experiece in a team -> at least first time we will have to work in a pair programmng manner in order to balance it.
2. Rather than that we do not see any other difficulties. Probably that is because of the fact that we are not enough profficient in this area so far.
